# How to approach Machine learning


## What is Machine learning

###  Machine learning and data mining

In short, machine learning is one step further from data mining; PREDICT the next step. <br>
Just like data mining, ML (machine learning) is also based on examining large databases in order to generate new information.


Here is a long answer for this question. <br>

## Machine learning tools

### install Anaconda3 w/ python 3.6.1.
For simplicity, I would recommend to use Anaconda following this guide below. <br>
I used a wintel machine to install it <br>

I had to insteal tenserflow two times, as two Anaconda navigator opened during installation.<br>
Other than tensorflow installation issue, installation process is straight-forward. <br>


### let's run the first neural network tutorial w/ python keras 
Once Anaconda + kera is installed, time to run a tutorial.<br>
