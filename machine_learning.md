# How to approach Machine learning


## What is Machine learning

###  Machine learning and data mining
Machine learning involves the study of algorithms that can extract information automatically (i.e., without on-line human guidance). Just like data mining, ML (machine learning) is also based on examining large databases in order to generate new information.<br>
<br>
In short, machine learning is one step further from data mining; machine learning PREDICTs the next step using the study algorithm. <br>

Here is a long answer for this question. <br>

## Machine learning tools

### tensorflow + keras
Keras is a high-level neural networks API can be used as a simplified interface to tensorflow.

Read this article what can we get it from keras w/ tensorflow

### install Anaconda3 w/ python 3.6.1.
Now, We have the official tensorflow installation guide here. but I do not recommend it.<br>
For simplicity, I would recommend to follow this guide below.

Following this guide, you will install Python libraries used for deep learning, specifically: Theano, TensorFlow, and Keras.<br>
here is my configurations;<br>
```
theano: 0.9.0.dev-c697eeab84e5b8a74908da654b66ec9eca4f1291
tensorflow: 1.2.0
keras: 2.0.5
```

### let's run the first neural network tutorial w/ python keras 
Once Anaconda + kera is installed, time to run a tutorial.<br>
